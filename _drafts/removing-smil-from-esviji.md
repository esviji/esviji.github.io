For those of you with Android devices, there is a new way to play esviji, with the publication of the game [in the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esviji.app). Go install it and play!

Another aim was to dig into SVG and SMIL animations, despite the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer would never support it. The recent announcement of SMIL deprecation in Blink (Chrome and Opera core browser engine) will lead me to abandon SMIL later this year in v3, in favor of either CSS based Web animations or a JavaScript animation library.
