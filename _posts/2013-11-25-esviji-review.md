Andrés y Johnatan has published [a nice review of the game (in spanish)](http://appsfirefoxos.blogspot.fr/2013/11/review-esviji.html) on his "Apps Firefox OS" blog.

The scores for different game features are pretty high, althrough the sound is clearly the weak one:

|Gameplay|4 / 5|
|Graphics|3 / 5|
|Fun|4 / 5|
|Innovation|4 / 5|
|Sound|2 / 5|
|General|4 / 5|

The conclusion, translated by Google:

> The truth is, it's a game that surprised us and we think it has a very interesting dynamic. Although [streaky?] at first, it seems worth giving a try :)
