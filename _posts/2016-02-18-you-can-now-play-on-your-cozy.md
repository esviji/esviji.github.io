Cozy started as a personal private cloud and app platform, and is now evolving into a universal tool that can help you organize your life and make you more productive by automating routine tasks. But it can also host any [client side app](https://blog.cozycloud.cc/post/2016/02/18/Client-Side-applications) you want, including games such as 2048 or esviji.

If you already have your Cozy, you just have to copy/paste this url into the “Install an app from it repository” field in your cozy’s store page: [https://github.com/jsilvestre/cozy-esviji/](https://github.com/jsilvestre/cozy-esviji/).

Thanks a lot [Joseph](https://github.com/jsilvestre) for this!

You can also [read the documentation](https://dev.cozy.io/clientsideapp.html) to create your own applications for Cozy.
