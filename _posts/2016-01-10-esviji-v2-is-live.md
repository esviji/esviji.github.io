After waaaay to many month of hard work on the code, almost 3 years after the first release ever, **esviji v2 is [finaly stable](https://twitter.com/esviji/status/686187986371899392)** and released live on [play.esviji.com](http://play.esviji.com/)!

esviji v2 is also already available [in the Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/esviji/) for all Firefox OS users, including automatic update for those who already installed previous version.

Most of the work all these months has been done on a new interface even more adaptable to any screen size and ratio, thanks to Responsive Web Design. The interface —previously only a single scalable SVG object— is now a flexible and responsive mix of HTML and CSS for most parts, and the SVG is now only used for the actual game board, where the balls evolve.

For technical inclined people, the responsive part is built with a lot of Media Queries and almost only viewport units for elements dimensions and positions.
