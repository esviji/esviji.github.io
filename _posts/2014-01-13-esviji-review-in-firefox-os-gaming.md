[Bob Thulfram](https://twitter.com/thulfram) has published [a very nice review of the game](http://firefoxosgaming.blogspot.fr/2014/01/esviji-game-review.html) on his "Firefox OS Gaming" blog.

Bob game the game **a score of 7â€¦ out of 5!**

The conclusion is really nice:

> I'm in love with this game and will keep it on my phones forever! Thank you, Nicolas Hoizey! And please do more. Let's not wait another 20 years.
